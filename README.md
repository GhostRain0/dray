# dray

dlang bindings to [raylib](https://github.com/xdrie/raylib) **v3.5.0**

## usage

all you need to do is add this package as a dependency and it should automatically build the C library and link it in.

note that `raylib` has some of its own dependencies such as OpenGL.

## example

see [example](example/), which demonstrates a simple application using these Raylib bindings.
